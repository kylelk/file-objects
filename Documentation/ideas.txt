use merkel trees to store the album structure.

add set operations to albums such as union, intersection and diffrence.
use the result of the operation to create a new album.

each object file starts with the object type name then the data length
then terminates with a null byte before the data begins, the same as 
the how the git version control system stores objects

to remove a file create an album containing the items to remove then
subtract the temporary album from the current album back into the current album

have a HEAD file which refrences the current head album path using the syntax
defined in album-path-example.txt

the basic object file types will be:
- blob
- tree
- file-info
